**Steps**
1.) Look at the guideline
2.) Align/label our questions for the guideline
3.) Choose an approach on how we'll present our story
4.) Divide the work to fill up the slides and present , choose the data/questions that you will use

Clean up:
- outline story
- compile the insights
 [ keep asking ( so what ) ] :
- **start with an end in mind**: end in mind is providing solution to Myanmar that we can learn from Cambodia ( everything else has to revolve around this )

Big overarching question:
	What is the situation? How's Myanmar's CO2 emissions in detail ( comparison to the other country, to sea, to lowest 
	

Transition to the next mention? (ask more questions)
	- Why is this the case? inc population,inc gdp
	- What are the causes? using fuels and stuff

Deepdive into one topic:
	- What's the cause of increased fuels (these are hand in hand w/ gdp,population)
	- what is the country currently doing 
	- so what can the country do?

Keep branching out the topic until the solution:
	- presenting benchmark
	- presenting their solutions

Keep branching out the topic until the solution:
	- present what myanmar can do / final recommendations
