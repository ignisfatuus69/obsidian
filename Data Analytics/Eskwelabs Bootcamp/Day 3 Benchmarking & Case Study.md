Game plan Version 2:

### [Benchmarking & Case Study]
> Have a meeting(this):
	- This meeting will just finalize the expected output for the slide/deck
	- So we can guide each other on the task that we all have to do
	- Output for the meeting: to just know the plans
	- No need to finish your output on the meeting, better to work without pressure, not finalized output anyway

> Finish this activity
	- This activity will serve as our baseline
	- We'll most likely use what we have here
	- We need to finish this activity so our mentor can give us feedback to make sure 	we're on the right track
