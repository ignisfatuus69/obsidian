*Example of a right skewed historgram*
* There's an outlier at the right side
* Most  average income are on the lower side

### Percentiles
* how a score compares to other scores of the same set
* the median is 1080 since percentiles show you where you are in terms of position ( we can apply this sa presentation)

### Range
* Range = Max-Min
* can also apply to the country
* useful in dividing into quartiles
### IQR
* 75th percentile - 25th percentile
* * useful in dividing into quartiles
* Use when you have extreme outliers

### SD and Variance
*Standard Deviation*
* average distance from the mean
* Looking for outliers ( within expectations, volatility )
* increase/decrease normal ( in our presentation)
*Variance*
* the spread of numbers in a data set
* (do more research on this)
