*My main goal is to equip myself with enough knowledge and skills in order to make fun and complex projects and have a better portfolio. This will be the last stretch that I need to have the confidence of being a "good" game programmer*

## STUDY
#### S.O.L.I.D PRINCIPLES
**Purpose**
* The purpose of solid principles is to always ensure that our code quality, readability and flexibility will always be in check and up to standards
* We can have a documentation and references to always check on whenever we plan out our code

#### PHYSICS
**Purpose**
* Physics has always been one of our weak points as a game developer
* Studying physics will allow me to design more games and cast away the fear of making physics games since some game companies want to make hyper-casual physics games

#### UNITY MULTIPLAYER
**Purpose**
* Some companies are looking for people who have an idea of multiplayer
* We also need this to make the multiplayer game that we have in mind
* Having a documentation and reference will make it way easier for us to implement the game as we have the step by step process on how it works
#### GAME OPTIMIZATIONS 
**Purpose**
* This is gonna be another one of our selling points as a game dev
* We can pretty much apply this to all our games, especially since they will be mobile
#### 3D CONCEPTS 
**Purpose**
* We need to learn more 3D concepts so we can be more comfortable in making 3D games
* This is gonna be another one of our selling point as a game dev and this will allow me to be more creative
* We also need to learn these 3D concepts as we build along our unity 3D multiplayer game


## PROJECTS

#### Musika

**Task**
* Finish project, make a to do list to expand here

**Purpose**
* Showcase our first and last project that's available on ios & android

#### 3D MULTIPLAYER PARTY GAME

**Task**
* Make an HCD and a list of to do to expand here
* The game will be similar to hypickle party games
* Game will have an extensive documentation including game inspirations
* Gauge the scope and have a game plan for everything especially big systems and code
* Implement and plan the game piece by piece and build on top of it instead of building a big whole and trimming it down
* Will probably have penguinz as inspiration

**Purpose**
* Showcase that we have a solid understanding of 3D games
* Showcase a few physics based games so we can showcase our understanding of game dev math
* To have a 3D game on my portfolio
* We can make this game have an extensive system so we can keep building on top of each party game
* Bro we can show this off and play with our frens
#### 2D RPG GAME SMALL PROTOTYPE

**Task**
* Make an HCD and a list of to do to expand here
* The game will be similar vampire survivorz but it will have fun combat
* Game will have an extensive documentation including game inspirations
* Gauge the scope and have a game plan for everything especially big systems and code
* Implement and plan the game piece by piece and build on top of it instead of building a big whole and trimming it down

**Purpose**
* Showcase our current programming skills
* Practice of S.O.L.I.D principles #solidprinciple
* Practice of game optimization
* Practice of game design patterns
* Practice of deployment and development on mobile
* We can implement ads (if we want to)
