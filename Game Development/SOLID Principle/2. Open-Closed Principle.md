* Makes your classes more flexible/customizable without having to keep modifying it for adjustments
* Creating **sub-classes for a "main class"** to customize instead of having if/else or booleans for further functionality
* Main class should always be **open for modification** without being **closed for extension**
* Sub classes are used for **modifications**
* The interface/parent of the sub classes (inheritance) are used as the **extension** for the main class
### Weapons & Launchers Example

#### Wrong Practice:
* Having a weapon class with options of bullets or missiles
* The weapon class has an if/else statement which modifies the weapon class' functionality to be a missile or a bullet launcher 
* The modifications are mainly on **setting the target and launching the projectiles**
* In order for us to make this weapon class to be more modifiable, we would have to add more if/else statements
* This is wrong because we keep modifying this class, which makes it prone to errors and can be difficult to manage

***ONE SINGLE WEAPON CLASS** which contains **multiple modifications: setting the target and launching the projectiles

#### Correct Practice 
* **BREAKING DOWN** the code if/statements or booleans into **sub-classes and interfaces** for **modifications**
* The purpose of the interface is for the function of Fire() to **have different functionalities for the same kind of weapon** but **used as an extension when the function is being called** 

*Components of weapon class broken down into an interface of ILauncher and having each launcher class inherit from it for modification

*The main class Weapon that connects to the subclasses and interfaces, calling out the fire function for the same kind of weapon
* Having the ****"main class"** connect to the sub-classes and interfaces** to call the functions which **extends them to the modifcations**
