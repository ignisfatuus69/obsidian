* Ensures that one script is responsibility for one thing only
* Keeps scripts/components small and simple
* Makes your components flexible/customizable
### Ship Example (Jason Weimann)

#### Wrong Practice:
* Having a big ship class that **handles multiple functionalities/responsibilities** (movement, health ,firing projectiles ,particles)
* Code lines reach 100+

***ONE BIG SHIP CLASS** which contains **multiple functionalities**

#### Correct Practice 
* **BREAKING DOWN** the one big ship classes into multiple components/scripts that only does **one function/responsibility**
* Number of code lines do not reach 100+

*Components of ship class broken down into single and smaller scripts

*An example of Ship Particles ( which is a component of a Ship), only handling the particles functionality of the ship
* Ship Particles can still rely on the other ship component classes to handle some of its functionalities **through connections of events** only
* On this example it connects with the classes of **ShipEngine** and **ShipHealth** so it can **disperse particles whenever the ship generates particles when it dies or when it changes direction**

### Bomb Example (Dapper Dino)
*Link: [(7) S.O.L.I.D Design Patterns - Unity - Single Responsibility Principle - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zJ4D2E0dI&t=2s)
#### Wrong Practice:
* Having a bomb class that **handles multiple functionalities/responsibilities** (timed event, detonation(area effect) ,event on collide)
* functionalities are not reusable and extensible

***ONE BOMB CLASS** which contains **multiple functionalities** 
![[Pasted image 20231009110225.png]]

#### Correct Practice 
* **BREAKING DOWN** the one bomb classes into multiple components/scripts that only does **one function/responsibility**
* Number of code lines do not reach 100+
* Every functionality can be reused and connect to each other instead of relying onto one another

*Components of bomb class broken down into single and smaller scripts and connected through events

*An example of Timer ( which is a component of a Bomb), only handling the particles functionality of the timer functionality
* Timer is a stand alone class which the other components can connect themselves by using the events of the timer ( as seen on the picture above)
* On this example it connects with the classes of **Area Damage** and **Destruction Action** so it can explode and do area damage and destroy objects once the timer is up (**OnTimerEnd**). The class **Trigger Overlap** is also connected to the **DetonateEarly** event so that it can fire up event **OnCollisionOverlap** whenever the bomb **detonates**.
