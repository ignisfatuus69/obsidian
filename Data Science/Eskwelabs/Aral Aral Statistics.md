*We take leverage on open source technology with big data analytics while still learning the core of statistics*

### Definitions
* Allows us to interact with our hypotheses and investigate relevant relationships
* Make inferences and predictions
* Inferences - new information from evidence #inferences

### Kinds of Statistics
**Descriptive**
* What are the characteristics of the respondents?
* Describing the values/summarizing the data set
	* Example: Mean,Median,Mode,average
**Inferential**
* What are the characteristics of the population?
	* Example: Analyzing how people perceive president duterte
		* Make a survey of 1k filipinos and assume that the answers will reflect the whole filipinos
		* Problem: can be prone to sample-biased
		* in data science: we don't need few samples of data sets because computers can process entires sample of big data
**Differences**
* Are two or more groups the same or different?
	* Example: Comparing populations, male vs female ?
**Associative**
* Are two or more variables related in a systematic way?
* Relevant to machine learning/deep learning
	* Example: correlations,principal component,analysis
**Prescriptive**
* provide recommendations to aide business decisions
* To aide business driven decisions / test different scenarios
**Predictive**
* Can we predict one variable if we know one or more other variables?
	* Example: Regressions, we have historial points -> what will happen in the future?*

### Purpose
* Saves resources
* Checks biases
* Quantifies changes

### First Steps Using Statistics 

#### 1.) Histogram
* showcase frequency of a given range of values
* Count of categories
* visual representation of distribution
* X-axis - category,time
* Y-axis - always numerical

#### 2.) Measures Of Central Tendency
* Summary statistic to describe data set
* Describing the relationships of the mean/median ( what does it mean when my mean is not the same as my median)
* Mean - average (Sum/divided number of values), susceptible to outliers (big values)
	* Example: Amount of exercise you did for the week, number of mrt passengers (these examples have limits and not susceptible to outliers)
* Median - middle position of a data set after it has been sorted and lined up
	* Example: average household income (1+2+3/6 = 2 but 1+1000/2 = 500.5)
* Mode - most frequent item, highest bar in histogram
	* Example: Most watched netflix show
