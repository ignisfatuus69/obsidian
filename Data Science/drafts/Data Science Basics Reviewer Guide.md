BASIC Topics to keep reviewing/mastering FOR NOW:

### [Python]
- Writing functions:
	- write functions for practice using descriptive statistics
	- write function for iterating string
	- write function for vowels chuchu
- List indexing:
	- :3 , has right side, all elements until 3rd index
	- 0: , has left side, pretty much all elements starting at first
	- 1:-1 , has both left and right
	- :-3 , last 3 elements
- List Methods:
	-appending
	-pop
	-index('element name')
- Tuples
	- swap numbers using tuples
	- have a function that return tuples 
- List  Comprehensions
	- finding countries w/ string length of 10, using loops
	- finding countries that are in SEA region, using loops
	- return all negative values and count the length of it
- Strings
	- formatting ( watch that vid again )

### [Pandas]
- Creating, Reading and Writing
	- Read data files
	- shape
	- head 
- Indexing, Selecting & Assigning
	- Access the columns
	- Access the first country
	- Access countries index -5 to 5
	- using iloc, access the first 3 columns showing 5 values
	- using iloc, access the 1-4 columns, showing 6 values
	- using loc, access first 5 countries
	- using loc, access the 6-10 elements with columns of country,co2 emission and population
	- using loc, access all the myanmar data only
	- using loc, access all the myanmar data with the year >= 2000
	- using loc, access all the SEA countries with isin function

### [Numpy]
* Creating arrays
* Numpy arrange
* Getting info about arrays
* Performing math in mupy
* Slicing and shaping (probably the most important topic)
* Iterating over multidimensional arrays
