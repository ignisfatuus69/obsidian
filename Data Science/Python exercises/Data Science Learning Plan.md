## Portfolio Building : ETA 1 Month
### Finish SYD EDA Practice (2-3 Full Days)
* We need this project in order to have a more solid basis and template for the next projects
* This also serves as a practice in coding without too much reliance on ChatGPT in generating code for data manipulation and charts
### Finish Video Game EDA Project (3-5 Days)
* This project will serve as one of my portfolio projects
* It should highlight my knowledge thus far outside of the bootcamp
* This will test the workflow that we have developed so far after finish SYD EDA Practice
* It's also good to include a video game project since we want to show how much skills would be transferrable from game dev to a business stand point
### Optional: Financial EDA Project (3-5 Days)
* This project will just serve as an extra portfolio and practice
* It's nice to include a financial project since a lot of data analytics job are related to finance 

## Further Learning : ETA 2-3 Months

### Machine Learning
* Finish Course 1 (Udemy)
* Cross reference/study with Course 2 (Udemy)
* Supplement learning w/ Machine Learning DeepAI (Coursera)
* Learn how to code it & the theory behind it
### Machine Learning Math
* Finish Imperial College London ( Coursera )
* Supplement Deep Learning AI ( Coursera )
### Optional: Microsoft Excel
