**Section 1: Array Creation**

1. Create a 1D array named `np1` containing integers from 1 to 12 using NumPy.
2. Create a 2D array named `np2` having two rows and six columns using NumPy.

**Section 2: Reshaping Arrays**

1. Reshape `np1` into a 3x4 array named `np3`.
2. Reshape `np1` into a 2x3x2 array named `np4`.

**Section 3: 1D vs 3D Array Shapes**

1. Illustrate reshaping `np5` to form:
    - `np6` with a shape of (4, 3)
    - `np7` with a shape of (4, 1, 3)

**Section 4: Methods for Creating Arrays**

1. Create an array of ones with a shape of (2, 3).
2. Generate a ranged array from 0 to 10 (exclusive) in steps of 2.
3. Create a random array with integers from 0 to 10 in a 3x5 shape.
4. Form a random array with values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 with a shape of (5, 3).

**Section 5: Getting Information**

1. Determine the size of `np4` and `np5`.
2. Find unique values within the `random_array` array.

**Section 6: Viewing Arrays and Index Slicing**

1. Perform index slicing on `np5`, `np6`, and `np7`.
2. Perform index steps on `np5`, `np6`, and `np7`.

**Section 7: Arithmetic and Aggregation**
