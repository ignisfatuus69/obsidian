**Madocs Online Health Care Service - Matplotlib Exercise Exam**

**Section 1: Anatomy of a Matplotlib Figure**

1. Explain the different components of a Matplotlib figure.
2. What is the role of the figure and axes objects in Matplotlib?
3. How would you create a Matplotlib figure with multiple subplots?

**Section 2: Scatter and Bar Plot**

1. Create a scatter plot displaying the relationship between appointment duration and consultation fee for practitioners using Matplotlib.
2. Design a bar plot showing the count of different types of transactions (from the 'Type' column) in the Cash Out Transactions dataset.

**Section 3: Histograms and Subplots**

1. Generate a histogram of the consultation fees charged by practitioners using Matplotlib.
2. Create a figure with subplots: one showing the distribution of appointment counts per user and another displaying the distribution of ratings given by patients.

**Section 4: Other Kinds of Plots**

1. Demonstrate the use of a pie chart representing the distribution of different medical services offered by the Madocs platform.
2. Plot a boxplot displaying the distribution of consultation fees for practitioners based on their specialization.

**Section 5: Plotting from Pandas Dataframes**

1. Plot the trend of appointment counts over time using data from the Appointments dataset.
2. Generate a line plot representing the quarterly performance ratings (Q4 to Q9 scores) for practitioners using the Ratings dataset.

**Section 6: Customizing Plots**

1. Apply customization to a scatter plot, including different colors for practitioners based on their years of experience.
2. Customize a line plot displaying the relationship between the appointment start time and the consultation fee.

**Section 7: Saving and Sharing Plots**

1. Save a bar plot showcasing the count of appointments for different reasons with appropriate labels and titles.
2. Explain the process of sharing Matplotlib plots in a Jupyter Notebook or exporting them to different file formats (PDF, PNG, etc.).
