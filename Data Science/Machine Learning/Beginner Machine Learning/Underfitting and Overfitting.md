*Finding the right amount of nodes for the model in order for the data to be accurate*

**Underfitting**
* If we divide a data to only have splits of 2-4. Each group still has a wide variety which means that it **generalizes the value way too much**  without taking into account more specificity. This happens because the model will have less chance of capturing distinctions and more patterns. (having less if statements/conditions/requirements). 

**Overfitting** 
* If we divide a data by too much. The **specificity and pattern becomes too narrow** to the point wherein the data becomes biased to **outliers**. (having way too much if statements/conditions/requirements)
