*Library for exploring and manipulating data with the use of DataFrame. 
* A **DataFrame** holds the data like a sheet in Excel or a table in SQL.
* DataFrame consists of (series) columns and rows. rows can be referred to as a #sample

[[Decision Trees]] 
*It's a machine learning model which divides the data into **categories of 2** and keeps expanding depending on the **tree depth/leaf nodes**

[[Model Validation]]
***Putting a score on the model** on how accurate its predictions are after it has predicted the values. This is done by **regression or classification**.
